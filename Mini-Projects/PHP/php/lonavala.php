            <p>There are many things which you find in the green covered mountainous regions and never-ending valleys. Among them, the<br> most capturing site is of lakes and small waterfalls that adorn it. Along with it comes the fact that humans have made artificial lakes for sustenance. Huge dams and engineering marvels created so that we can survive in any place of our choice without breaking a sweat. Lonavala being one such place has many small lakes. Some made naturally and some by ingenious human minds. Either way, it is a visual treat to be around one of them. Few things can match the peace one experiences near water, and that’s something Lonavala has in abundance. A few of the lakes and dams include the following.

                  Valvan Dam has a garden at its foot and is a popular evening spot 2 km from the town. The dam supplies water to the Khopoli power station at the foothills of the Sahyadris for generating electricity. The Kundali River feeds into the dam’s reservoir.<br>
